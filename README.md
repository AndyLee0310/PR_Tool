  1. [Fork](http://help.github.com/fork-a-repo/) the project, clone your fork, and configure the remotes:
  
      ```bash
      # Clone your fork of the repo into the current directory
      git clone https://github.com/Ming119/PR_Tool
      # Navigate to the newly cloned directory
      cd PR_Tool
      # Assign the original repo to a remote called "upstream"

      ```

  2. If you cloned a while ago, get the latest changes from upstream:
  
      ```bash
      git checkout <dev-branch>
      git pull upstream <dev-branch>
      ```
  
  3. Create a new topic branch (off the main project development branch) to contain your feature, change, or fix:

      ```bash
      git checkout -b <topic-branch-name>
      ```

  4. Locally merge (or rebase) the upstream development branch into your topic branch:

      ```bash
      git pull [--rebase] upstream <dev-branch>
      ```

  5. Push your topic branch up to your fork:

      ```bash
